# Kaprekar Number

A Kaprekar number is a unique integer where its square can be split into two parts,
and the sum of these parts equals the original number. The split is not fixed by digit
 count, and the right part must be positive. For example, 45 is a Kaprekar number because
 45Â² = 2025, and 20 + 25 equals 45. This concept provides a fascinating insight   into
 number theory.
